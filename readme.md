# Welcome to SockTalk

A WebSocket-based chatting platform/protocol designed for developers.

## What Can You Do with SockTalk?

SockTalk is built for flexibility, made to allow developers to create their own custom chatting applications. Here are the features:

- **Minimal Requirements**:
  - Create an account.
  - Provide the server with your API key and message.
- **Customizable Protocol**:
  - The server passes all additional data to connected clients, letting you design your own features and protocols.

### Examples of What You Can Build

With SockTalk, you have the tools to create:
- **Reply Systems**: Add threaded conversations or quote replies.
- **User Mentioning**: Notify users when they’re mentioned in a message.
- **User Blocking**: Implement features to filter or block specific users.

I doubt this will be updated often, since, honestly, everything is handled by the clients. Soooo... have fun!
